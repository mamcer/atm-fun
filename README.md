# ATM Fun

This project was part of a technical exam that have to be completed in just a couple of hours.

The proposed topic was a basic ATM. Authenticate with your card and pin, select and execute an operation: balance or withdraw. Also most important actions needs to be logged in a database table.

The core functionality and entities are almost untouch (very basic). I have then included more test projects, application versioning, stylecop, cmd files to measure code coverage, deploy the application, etc.

> I took this simple project as an example from the folder, solution structure and use of tools. I wrote a [blog post](https://mamcer.github.io/2018-08-27-net-framework-sample-solution/) explaining details.
